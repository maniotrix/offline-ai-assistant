# 🛠 Why We Built Karna from Scratch (Instead of Using a Pretrained VLM)

Karna isn’t just another AI tool — it's designed to be a **practical, private, edge-deployable visual agent** that works for *real people* on *real machines*.

---

## ✅ 1. Runs on Consumer Edge Devices — Even CPU-Only Laptops

We engineered Karna to function on:

- 💻 CPU-only systems (with tolerable lag)
- 🧠 Basic GPUs with ≥ **2GB VRAM** (like GTX 1050, MX250, etc.)
- 🧓 Even 6–7-year-old PCs (tested on GTX 1060 with 6GB VRAM)

> If it runs on that, it runs for 90% of the world.

This makes Karna a **true personal edge-device AI agent**, not a cloud-tethered experiment.

## ✅ 2. Real-Time Enough, With Zero Cloud Dependency

We’re not aiming for giant model hallucination. We're aiming for **fast and reliable visual action**:

- ⚡ Instant response on GPU
- ⚙️ Acceptable delays on CPU
- 🌐 No cloud latency or API throttles

> **You control it. You host it. You trust it.**

---

## ✅ 3. Full Local Privacy with Pixel-Level Perception

Karna doesn’t send screenshots or sensitive data anywhere:

- 📸 Screens are processed locally
- 🔒 No online inference, no cloud logging
- 📁 Suitable for enterprise, education, and offline deployments

> Your UI, your pixels, your machine — never the cloud.

---

## ✅ 4. Precision First: Pixel-Accurate UI Understanding

Generic VLMs struggle with:

- ❌ Precise element detection
- ❌ Bounding box accuracy
- ❌ Complex UI layouts

Karna uses:
- **YOLO** for box-level object detection
- **OCR** for exact text anchors
- **ResNet** for visual patch memory

> It sees **what matters** — and knows **where it is.**

---

## ✅ 5. Purpose-Built for Interaction, Not Just Captioning

Unlike GPT-4V, Gemini, or MiniGPT, Karna doesn’t just describe — it **acts**:

- 🎯 Clicks real buttons
- ⌨️ Types into real fields
- 🔄 Retries when needed
- 🧠 Plans visual actions step-by-step

> It's not just "vision + language" — it's **vision → reasoning → action.**

## 🚫 Why Pretrained VLMs Weren’t Enough

| Requirement                         | VLMs (GPT-4V, Gemini, MiniGPT) | **Karna** |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------|
| Runs on CPU-only or 2GB GPU systems| ❌                             | ✅         |
| Works offline, no cloud            | ❌                             | ✅         |
| Pixel-accurate UI understanding    | ❌                             | ✅         |
| Executes real mouse/keyboard tasks | ❌                             | ✅         |
| Supports modular tool calling      | ❌                             | ✅         |
| Customizable for personal devices  | ❌                             | ✅         |

## 🧠 Bottom Line

We didn’t build Karna to compete with giants — we built it because **they don’t work for the real world we live in**:

- Students on mid-range laptops
- Developers with privacy needs
- Makers without cloud budgets

> Karna is what you build when you care about **precision**, **privacy**, and **practicality** — for *everyone*, not just those with 8× A100s and a $10k API budget.
