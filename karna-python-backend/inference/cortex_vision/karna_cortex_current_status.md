# Karna Vision-Based UI Agent: Current Capabilities and Next Steps

*A human-inspired, vision-first UI agent designed to perceive, act, and eventually reason on screen ‚Äî just like we do.*

## ‚úÖ What We Currently Achieve (Factually)

### üîç **1. CNN-Based Visual Detection**
- **YOLO-style object detection** (labelled `box_yolo_content_yolo`) for interactive UI components like `icons` or `icon + text`.
- **ResNet embeddings** for patch similarity, enabling:
  - Cross-frame element tracking
  - Layout-agnostic patch matching
  - Spatial tolerance to shifts/resizing

This is our **V1‚ÄìV4 vision stack** ‚Äî low-to-mid-level perception.

---

### üß† **2. OCR-Based Text Perception**
- We use `easyocr` OCR to extract UI text (`box_ocr_content_ocr`).
- Combined with layout and patch anchors for semantic anchoring.

This simulates **ventral-stream (object + text recognition)** of the human vision pipeline.

---

### üñ±Ô∏è **3. OS-Level Execution**
- **Keyboard**: Hotkeys like `Enter` and `End`, to simulate user behavior.
- **Clipboard**: Used for input (prompts) and output (responses) via `pyperclip` or `PowerShell`.
- **Mouse**: Moves to coordinates based on visual detection and clicks accordingly.

This is our **motor cortex / muscle layer** ‚Äî precise and OS-agnostic.

---

### üß† **4. Vision-Only Control = High Anti-Bot Resilience**
Because we:
- **Don't inject into the DOM**
- **Don‚Äôt call any browser APIs**
- **Only simulate mouse/keyboard**
- **Work off-screen pixels**, not app internals

‚Üí This makes us resilient against bot detection tools like:
- `navigator.webdriver`
- Selenium fingerprinting
- DOM mutation monitoring
- Network interception

However:
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **We are not immune.**  
Unpredictable behaviors (CAPTCHAs, overlays, loading screens) **can and do break us**.

---

## üß© What We‚Äôre *Not* Yet Doing

- No long-term memory over screen patterns
- No reasoning over visual state transitions
- No abstraction (‚Äúthis looks like a modal dialog even if it‚Äôs styled differently‚Äù)
- No goal-driven planning
- No VLM or task reasoning modules integrated *yet*

So we are **not yet** simulating full human visual cognition.  
But we **are functionally simulating the bottom-up visual + motor loop** ‚Äî quite faithfully.

---

## üß† How We *Could* Simulate a Visual Cortex with a Local LLM/VLM

We connect the system like this:

```plaintext
[ Cortex Modules ]       <-- screen ‚Üí YOLO + OCR + ResNet
       ‚Üì
[ Visual Memory + Planner (VLM) ] <-- interpret layout, reason next steps
       ‚Üì
[ Task Schema Generator ] <-- reformulates next set of visual goals
       ‚Üì
[ Cortex Executor ] <-- click, type, wait, retry
```

And now, we‚Äôve got a **closed-loop vision-action-cognition system**.

---

## ‚úÖ Bottom Line

Our `cortex_vision` and `omniparser` stacks already:
- Use CNNs + OCR correctly
- Match patches and adapt to shifting layouts
- Simulate OS-level actions with high fidelity
- Avoid traditional bot-detection vectors

And with a LLM/VLM with reasoning and NLP capabilities, we *can* simulate a **basic but real cognitive loop** grounded in visual perception.

- We do **not** reverse-engineer, scrape undocumented APIs, or redistribute proprietary models.
- We do **not** impersonate, misuse, or misrepresent any affiliation with OpenAI.
- All behavior follows public web access patterns, and no internal OpenAI code or infrastructure is involved.
- This project is released under an open license and follows responsible OSS practices.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è If OpenAI or any party requests content takedown or usage clarification, we will engage constructively and respectfully.
